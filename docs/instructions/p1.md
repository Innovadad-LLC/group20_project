## Introduction

This project is based on an ecommerce store which sells products to end-users. It will allow users to signup to enable them to purchase products. New and existing customers will be allowed to browse the catalog of products in order to make their purchases. When the user logs off, their session will end, and they will need to login to access the system again. The product total should reflect the product and quantity of each item in the cart. End-users should receive messages on the screen indicating they have made an invalid selection or inputted invalid data.

## Requirements

- **REQ-JT1:** 
  - **Description:** Populate database with more products.
  - **Type:** Functional
  - **Priority:** 3
  - **Rationale:** Populating the database with more products will allow for better UX design and logic to be incorporated into the implementation of the project.
  - **Testing:** Upon completion, more data should be available for testing which means the database has more than the three initial values.
- **REQ-JT2:** 
  - **Description:** Modify HTML and Python to populate dynamic fields such as price and quantity dropdown lists. 
  - **Type:** Functional
  - **Priority:** 2
  - **Rationale:** This modification will provide the user with more real-time data when adding products to the cart.
  - **Testing:** Testing will comprise of validating that the price and quantities are updated appropriately.
- **REQ-JT3:** 
  - **Description:** Add validation and error handling to forms using HTML, CSS, and Python
  - **Type:** Functional
  - **Priority:** 1
  - **Rationale:** Adding validation and error handling to HTML forms will prevent bad data from populating the database as well as protect against malicious attacks on the system. 
  - **Testing:** Testing against invalid characters, incomplete forms, and duplicate entries.

## Constraints

- Due to the scale and time constraints of this project, features such as pagination, tax assessments by state, payment method entry, and applying discounts to products at checkout are not enabled for this project.
- Only standard Python, HTML, CSS (mainly Bootstrap), and (some) JavaScript are used for this project. Libraries such as Angular or React are out of the scope of this project.

## Use Cases

- **UC-JT1:** 
  - **Description:** Signing up or logging in should allow user access to system to place orders.
  - **Actors:** End-user
  - **Preconditions:** The user must enter valid data into forms with no special characters or missing required data.
  - **Postconditions:** User is allowed to place an order after completion of either form type.
- **UC-JT2:** 
  - **Description:** Format of screen should change based on device being used to allow for better accessibility and readability.
  - **Actors:** End-user
  - **Preconditions:** The user must have an up-to-date browser that recognizes the most recent HTML standards and CSS capabilities.
  - **Postconditions:** User is presented a website that is readily available for their device.

## User Stories

- **US-JT1:** 
  - **Type of User:** End-user
  - **Description:** As an end-user, I should be able to login or sign up and my session should not end until I log off, keeping all relevant data and products active while I am using the system. When logged into the site, my cart should be updated appropriately based on the price and quantity of the product I have chosen. Upon checkout, my total should be accurate based on my selections.
- **US-JT2:** 
  - **Type of User:** Admin
  - **Description:** The system should not allow missing or invalid data to be entered into the forms due to the potential of malicious code corrupting the system. The database should also encrypt passwords to ensure customer data is protected. All data from the end-user should be checked against the standards such as no spaces or invalid characters for usernames and passwords, valid email formats, and correct length for passwords.

## Glossary

- **Term:** The term that is being defined. This should be a single word or phrase that is being defined.
  - **End-user:** The user of the system. Often referred to as the customer or consumer.
